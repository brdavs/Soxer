= 0.9.13 / 2011-05-23
  
  * Added a completely new feature: Static website creation.
  
  * Fixed a bug generating paths in lists. This was a serious bug and in 
    some cases made the site useless for navigation.

= 0.9.12 / 2011-04-30
  
  * Fixed a slipped variable name, that disabled UUID generation.
  
= 0.9.11 / 2011-04-30
  
  * Fixed relative paths in config.ru for app requirement.
  
  * Fixed scoping inside classes. This was a severe bug.
    It's a mistery how it worked until sinatra 1.2.3...
  
  * Deleted unneeded classes.
  
  * Added initialization to objects.
  
  * Properly modularized Soxer. There are now no global settings that
    Soxer uses
  
  * Soxer sets up several application speciffic directories, which can be
    changed inside SoxerApp.
    
  * Setting up the root of application is now mandatory.
  
  * Changed and cleaned skeletal application's app.rb and config.ru files
    to reflect the new modularity.
  
  * Renamed config.yml to config.yml.example, added cosmetic fixes to it.
  
= 0.9.10 / 2011-03-22
  
  * The function get_list now returns an array of hashies. This was a severe
    inconsistency.
  
  * Fixed incompatibility with Ruby 1.9.2+ where app.rb was called without a
    local path.
  
  * Completely rewritten inclusion of empty directories to facilitate a more
    flexible skeleton project creation.
  
  * Added a blog skeleton to the list of project skeletons.
  
= 0.9.9 / 2011-03-03

  * Changed the names of Classes to match CamelCase convention in Ruby
  
  * Added .eot font to the mime collection to Rack
  
  * Cleaned up the superfluous blocks of documentation.
  
  * Fixed interpretation of layout: 'false' statement, if used inside yaml 
    file.
  
  * Added dependency on 'hashie' gem. Now page keys can be accessed 
    as hash keys(strings or symbols) as well as methods.
    The following will yield the same: page[:date], page['date'], page.date
  
  * Finally resolved the inclusion of empty directories within skeleton dirs.
  
= 0.9.8 / 2010-11-28
  
  * Standardized and beautified code (no particular standard though.)
  
  * Rdoc documentation rewritten from scratch.
  
  * YAML file downloading disabled. This was a severe bug.
  
  * Url-to-file routing completely redone, now far more flexible and 
    extensible, while less error prone.
  
  * Atom feed generator completely redone. Not backwards compatible. However, 
    it was not logical and mostly broken anyway.
  
  * Added breadcrumb generator function
  
  * Added ttf/otf mime types to default Rack set
  
  * Fixed skeleton creation to include empty directories.
  
  * Development mode output padded with newline. Annoyance only.
  
  * get_list now filters list of files: If both 'dir/something.yaml' and 
    'dir/something/index.html' exist, only the first is included.
      
  * Fixed sitemap generator to use new settings.origin. This was a severe bug.

= 0.9.7 / 2010-11-03
  
  * Fixed "views/css/css.sass" for empty skeleton to comply with new sass 
    notation.
  
  * Created a README.markdown document
  
  * Added sinatra-reloader as dependency, although it's only needed in 
    development mode.
  
  * Added proper license
  
= 0.9.6.1 / 2010-11-01
  
  * Soxer binary cleanup

  * Fixed empty skeleton for proper soxer inclusion
  
  * Fixed soxer binary for empty skeleton creation
    
= 0.9.6 / 2010-10-31

  * Forgot to include the streamlined empty skeleton for a modular style
    application.
  
= 0.9.5 / 2010-10-31

  * Inline documentation has been adjusted and slightly improved.
  
  * The value of settings.origin is now a global system path, rather than a
    local path from settings.root. Default is set to 'content', but you can
    change it by Sinatra's standards.
  
  * Atom file as progressed from -atom to .atom (dot atom) and soxer will now
    server /any/path/to/file.atom with the application/atom+xml content type.
  
  * Soxer has been modularized to Sinatra's standards, with the exception of
    the name. It's still named soxer and not sinatra-soxer. This might change
    in the future as we hit stable.
      
  * Changed get_list method. It only accepts a block for filtering yaml files
    Any sorting is now done by Array.sort {} afterwards.
  
  * Fixed partial generator so it properly handles strings and symbols
  
  * Cleaned up "soxer test" and only choose "thin" web server if available.
    Defaults to webrick (very slow).

= 0.9.4 / 2010-10-27
  
  * Added executable 'soxer' to help generating application directories and
    running development versions
    
  * Added skeletal directories, and 'empty' skeleton application

= 0.9.0 / 2010-10-24

  * Initial release
