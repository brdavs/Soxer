= 0.9.5 / 2010-10-00

  * Inline documentation has been adjusted and slightly improved.
  
  * The value of settings.origin is now a global system path, rather than a
    local path from settings.root. Default is set to 'content', but you can
    change it by Sinatra's standards.
  
  * Atom file as progressed from -atom to .atom (dot atom) and soxer will now
    server /any/path/to/file.atom with the application/atom+xml content type.
  
  * Soxer has been modularized to Sinatra's standards, with the exception of
    the name. It's still named soxer and not sinatra-soxer. This might change
    in the future as we hit stable.
      
  * Changed get_list method. It only accepts a block for filtering yaml files
    Any sorting is now done by Array.sort {} afterwards.
  
  * Fixed partial generator so it properly handles strings and symbols
  
  * Cleaned up "soxer test" and only choose "thin" webserver if available.
    Defaults to webrick (very slow).
